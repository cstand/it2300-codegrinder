# Exam 2

The table is: NetflixRevenue

The columns are:
```
+------+----------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Date | Global Revenue | UCAN_ARPU | EMEA_ARPU | LATM_ARPU | APAC_ARPU |
+------+----------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
```

ARPU is a metric that stands for average revenue per user.

## Problem 5

For each date get the overall average revenue per user. 
Get this by adding the 4 areas together and then dividing by 4.
Make sure to round it to 2 decimals.

The first few lines would look like this.
```
+------------+-------------------------------+
| ReviewDate | Total Average Reveue Per User |
+------------+-------------------------------+
| 31-03-2019 |        -9.72                  |
+------------+-------------------------------+
|30-06-2019  |         10.02                 |
```
